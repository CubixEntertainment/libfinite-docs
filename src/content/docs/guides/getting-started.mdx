## Prerequisites

To get started developing with libfinite, you'll need these prerequisites

<Aside>The Infinite Library is intended to be used on a Linux based system.</Aside>

🔸 [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm) - A C based Graphics Math library

🔸 [Wayland](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland) - The window compositing protocol.

🔸 [Wayland Protocols](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols) - Additional Non Standard features for Wayland. (v1.24 or higher)

🔸 [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/) - Graphics Library for drawing data to buffers.

🔸 [Vulkan](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/) - An explicit graphical libary that gives users the full control over the rendering process.

🔸 [xkbcommon](https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon) - Keymap library.

🔸 [libevdev](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libevdev/) - evdev device library

🔸 [sndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) - C library for reading and writing audio data

🔸 [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) - The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture

🔸 [Meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) - The Meson Build System

Also make sure you've built the library from source as `sudo`

```sh
meson setup build --prefix=/usr
sudo ninja -C build install
```

## Required Files

In order to build a libfinite project you'll need these files which we've graciously provided.

- [xdg-shell.xml](../starter-files/xdg-shell.xml)
- [layer-shell.xml](../starter-files/layer-shell.xml)
- [meson.build](../starter-files/meson.build)

These files should be in the root of your project. They are required to make libfinite work correctly.
