The `FiniteJoystick` struct stores data about a controller's joystick.

```c
typedef struct {
    char *name;
    uint16_t xAxis;
    double xValue; // value between -1 and 1
    int xMin;
    int xMax;
    int xFlat; // deadzone
    uint16_t yAxis;
    double yValue;
    int yMin;
    int yMax;
    int yFlat;
} FiniteJoystick;
```

## Specification

Developers in general are discourageed from trying to read data from a gamepad directly as they are a "voliatile type" Controllers can be disconnected at any time for any reason and as such this struct may not always exist when trying to read it even after verifying its existance (TOCTOU).
