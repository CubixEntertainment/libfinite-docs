<Aside> FiniteShell was last modifed in **v0.7.0** </Aside>

The `FiniteShell` struct stores information about a keyboard.

```c
typedef struct {
    FiniteInput *input;

    struct wl_keyboard *keyboard;
    struct xkb_context *xkb_ctx;
    struct xkb_keymap *xkb_keymap;
    struct xkb_state  *xkb_state;

    FiniteKeyState keys[256];
} FiniteKeyboard;
```

## Properties

| Type                            | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FiniteInput *input`            | The FiniteInput struct that contains the needed compositor information. This is an internal type.   |
| `struct wl_keyboard *keyboard`  | The [`wl_keyboard`](https://wayland-book.com/seat/keyboard.html) related to the keyboard.           |
| `struct xkb_context *xkb_ctx`   | The xkb keyboard context for the keyboard.                                                          |
| `struct xkb_keymap *xkb_keymap` | The xkb keymap data for the keyboard that determines what keyboard layout is in use.                |
| `struct xkb_state  *xkb_state`  | The xkb state of the keyboard                                                                       |
| `FiniteKeyState keys`           | An array of FiniteKeyStates. Each item represents a possible input, but not all inputs may be used. |

## Specification

`FiniteKeyboard`s should **not** be the only input source. Developers should use [`FiniteGamepad`](/reference/finiteinput/types/finitegamepad) as their main source of user input.

`FiniteKeyboard` refers to physically connected keyboard. As 0.7.0, there is no built in solution for Virtual Keybaord, but that is planned for future updates.
