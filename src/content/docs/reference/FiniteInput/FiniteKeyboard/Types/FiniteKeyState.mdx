The `FiniteKeyState` struct stores the state of a speicific keyboard input

```c
typedef struct {
    uint16_t id;
    bool isHeld;
    bool isDown;
    bool isUp;
} FiniteKeyState;
```

## Properties

| Type          | Description                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uint16_t id` | The linux evdev code of the given input.                                         |
| `bool isHeld` | Whether the button is being held down. Acts as combined state of isDown and isUp |
| `bool isDown` | Whether the button is currently being pressed down.                              |
| `bool isUp`   | Whether the button is not being pressed down.                                    |

## Specification

`FiniteKeyState`s should **not** be created manually. Developers should let [`finite_input_keyboard_init`](/reference/finiteinput/functions/finite_input_keyboard_init/) handle creating and managing the FiniteKeyState of each individual key.
