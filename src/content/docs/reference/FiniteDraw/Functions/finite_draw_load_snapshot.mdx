<Aside> finite_draw_load_snapshot was last modifed in **v0.6.0** </Aside>

The `finite_draw_load_snapshot` function attempts to restore a cairo surface from a restore point.

```c
void finite_draw_load_snapshot(FiniteShell *shell)
```

## Parameters

| Type                 | Description                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FiniteShell *shell` | The [`FiniteShell`](../../../finiteshell/finiteshell)where the window is. |

## Code Example

```c
#include <finite/draw.h>

finite_draw_load_snapshot(myShell);
finite_draw_finish(myShell);
```

## Standard Usage

<Aside type="caution">
  finite_draw_load_snapshot was deprecated in **v0.7.0** and will be removed in v1.0.0.
  Use `cairo_restore` instead.
</Aside>

This function must have a valid `FiniteShell`

This function uses Cairo which requires a valid cairo_surface_t in `FiniteShell.cairo_surface` beforehand.

This function copys all current data on screen and stores it in `FiniteShell.snapshot` in `FiniteShell`

At some point [`finite_draw_finish`](../finite_draw_finish) should be called to apply the changes made by the snapshot visually.
