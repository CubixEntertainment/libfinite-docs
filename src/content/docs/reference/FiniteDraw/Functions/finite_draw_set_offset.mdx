<Aside> finite_draw_set_offset was last modifed in **v0.6.0** </Aside>

The `finite_draw_set_offset` function attempts to set an offset for future drawing.

```c
void finite_draw_set_offset(FiniteShell *shell, double x, double y)
```

## Parameters

| Type                 | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `FiniteShell *shell` | The FiniteShell where the window  is. |
| `double x`           | The X offset.                                   |
| `double y`           | The Y offset.                                   |

## Code Example

```c
#include <finite/draw.h>

// create a color for later
FiniteColorGroup grayGlass = {
    .r = 0.152,
    .g = 0.152,
    .b = 0.152,
    .a = 1
};

double miniWindow[4] = {
    ((shell->details->width  * 40) / 100), // x
    ((shell->details->height * 20) / 100), // y
    ((shell->details->width  * 55) / 100), // width
    ((shell->details->height * 60) / 100)  // hieght
};

finite_draw_set_offset(shell, miniWindow[0], miniWindow[1]);

finite_draw_rounded_rect(shell, miniWindow[0], miniWindow[1], miniWindow[2], miniWindow[3], 35, &grayGlass, NULL, true);
FiniteColorGroup outline = {
    .r = 0.788,
    .g = 0.788,
    .b = 0.788,
    .a = 0.4
};

finite_draw_stroke(shell, &outline, NULL, 6);
```

## Notes

This function is used to offset the drawing position of **all** draw functions. Even though some functions may manually take in x and y positions, they are universally affected by this function.

If `shell.cr` is undefined, this function will create a new Cairo draw tool and set it to `shell.cr`

## Standard Usage

<Aside type="caution">
  finite_draw_set_offset was deprecated in **v0.7.0** and will be removed in
  v1.0.0. Use `cairo_translate` instead.
</Aside>

Offsets apply to everything drawn after it's been set as long as it's using the same `shell.cr`.

You should at some point call the inverse of this function (`finite_draw_set_offset(-x, -y)`) to reset the offset back to 0,0.

This function must have a valid [`FiniteShell`](/reference/finiteshell/finiteshell/)

This function uses Cairo which requires a valid cairo_surface_t in `FiniteShell.cairo_surface` beforehand.
