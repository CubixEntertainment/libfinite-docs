The `finite_button_delete_all` function removes all `FiniteBtn` instances from a `FiniteShell`, freeing their memory and clearing the button array.

```c
void finite_button_delete_all(FiniteShell *shell);
```

## Parameters

| Type                 | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `FiniteShell *shell` | The shell from which all buttons will be deleted. |

## Code Example

```c
FiniteBtn *btn = finite_button_create(shell, select_cb, NULL, NULL, NULL);
FiniteBtn *btn2 = finite_button_create(shell, select_cb, NULL, NULL, NULL);

finite_button_delete_all(shell);
```

## Standard Usage

The `shell` must be valid and contain at least one button.
This function frees all buttons and their associated `relations` data.
After execution, `FiniteShell.btns` is set to `NULL` and `FiniteShell._btns` should be considered 0.
