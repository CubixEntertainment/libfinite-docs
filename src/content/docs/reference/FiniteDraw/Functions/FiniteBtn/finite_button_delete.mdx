The `finite_button_delete` function removes a `FiniteBtn` from a `FiniteShell`, freeing its memory and maintaining the integrity of the `FiniteShell.btns` array.

```c
void finite_button_delete(FiniteShell *shell, int id);
```

## Parameters

| Type                 | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FiniteShell *shell` | The shell containing the button to delete.                    |
| `int id`             | The `id` of the button to delete in the shell’s button array. |

## Code Example

```c
FiniteBtn *btn = finite_button_create(shell, select_cb, NULL, NULL, NULL);
FiniteBtn *btn2 = finite_button_create(shell, select_cb, NULL, NULL, NULL);

finite_button_delete(shell, 1);
```

## Standard Usage

The `shell` must be valid and contain the button to delete.

`id` must be within the range of existing buttons (`0` to `shell->_btns - 1`).

After deletion, all buttons after the removed one are shifted to maintain contiguous indexing.
