The `FiniteDirectionType` enum defines all possible directional inputs for navigation between `FiniteBtn` instances in a `FiniteShell`.

```c
typedef enum {
    FINITE_DIRECTION_UP,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_DOWN,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_LEFT,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_RIGHT,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_LEFT_UP,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_LEFT_DOWN,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_RIGHT_UP,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_RIGHT_DOWN,
    FINITE_DIRECTION_DONE
} FiniteDirectionType;
```

## Properties

| Type                          | Description                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_UP`         | Up direction.                       |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_DOWN`       | Down direction.                     |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_LEFT`       | Left direction.                     |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_RIGHT`      | Right direction.                    |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_LEFT_UP`    | Up-left diagonal direction.         |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_LEFT_DOWN`  | Down-left diagonal direction.       |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_RIGHT_UP`   | Up-right diagonal direction.        |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_RIGHT_DOWN` | Down-right diagonal direction.      |
| `FINITE_DIRECTION_DONE`       | Reserved value.                     |

## Standard Usage

`FINITE_DIRECTION_DONE` is reserved and should not be used in application code.

This enum is intended for use with `FiniteBtn` instances in a `FiniteShell`.

Directional values define navigation relationships between buttons.

Functions that consume this enum (e.g., in `FiniteBtn.relations`) expect valid directional values, excluding FINITE_DIRECTION_DONE.
