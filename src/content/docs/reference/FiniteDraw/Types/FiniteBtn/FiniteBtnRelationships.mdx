The `FiniteBtnRelationShips` struct describes the relationship between a given button and it's neighbors.

```c
typedef struct {
    int left;
    int right;
    int down;
    int up;
    // optional diagonals
    int leftUp;
    int rightUp;
    int leftDown;
    int rightDown;
} FiniteBtnRelationShips;
```
