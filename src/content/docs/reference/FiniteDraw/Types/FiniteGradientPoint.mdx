The `FiniteGradientPoint` struct represents a point in a gradient with a specific position and color.

```c
typedef struct {
    double stop;
    double r;
    double g;
    double b;
    double a;
} FiniteGradientPoint;
```

## Properties

| Type          | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `double stop` | The position of the gradient stop (0.0 to 1.0).      |
| `double r`    | Red component of the color (0.0 to 1.0).             |
| `double g`    | Green component of the color (0.0 to 1.0).           |
| `double b`    | Blue component of the color (0.0 to 1.0).            |
| `double a`    | Alpha (opacity) component of the color (0.0 to 1.0). |

## Standard Usage

The `stop` value should be between 0.0 (start of gradient) and 1.0 (end of gradient).

Each `FiniteGradientPoint` defines a single point in a gradient. multiple points are needed to form a full gradient.
