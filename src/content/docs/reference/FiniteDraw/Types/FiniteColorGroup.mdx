The `FiniteColorGroup` struct stores RGBA color values as doubles, used for rendering with cairo.

```c
typedef struct {
    double r;
    double g;
    double b;
    double a;
} FiniteColorGroup;
```

## Properties

| Type       | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `double r` | Red component (0.0 to 1.0).             |
| `double g` | Green component (0.0 to 1.0).           |
| `double b` | Blue component (0.0 to 1.0).            |
| `double a` | Alpha (opacity) component (0.0 to 1.0). |

## Standard Usage

All values must be normalized between 0.0 and 1.0. To convert from standard 0–255 RGB values, divide by 255.0.

Compatible with `FiniteTextGroup` or other structures that reference RGBA colors.
