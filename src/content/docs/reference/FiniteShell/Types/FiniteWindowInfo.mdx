The `FiniteWindowInfo` struct stores information about a window managed by a `FiniteShell`, including position and size.

```c
typedef struct {
    struct wl_output *output;
    int32_t xPos;
    int32_t yPos;
    int32_t width;
    int32_t height;
} FiniteWindowInfo;
```

## Properties

| Type                       | Description                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `struct wl_output *output` | The Wayland output associated with this window.      |
| `int32_t xPos`             | The horizontal position of the window on the output. |
| `int32_t yPos`             | The vertical position of the window on the output.   |
| `int32_t width`            | The width of the window in pixels.                   |
| `int32_t height`           | The height of the window in pixels.                  |

## Notes

`xPos` and `yPos` represent the top-left corner of the window relative to the Wayland output.

## Standard Usage

`width` and `height` represent the current resolution of the window. Their default values are the screen resolution. Developers should store these values for future use.

All fields must reflect the actual compositor-provided window values; do not manually override them in production code.

This struct is intended to be read-only for most applications. Changes should be applied through [`finite_window_size_set`](/reference/finiteshell/functions/finite_window_size_set/) rather than modifying these fields directly.
