The `FiniteRenderReturnBuffer` struct represents a fully created Vulkan buffer and its memory allocation, including layout information for vertex and optional index data.

```c
struct FiniteRenderReturnBuffer {
    bool _indices;
    VkBuffer buf;
    VkDeviceMemory mem;
    VkDeviceSize vertexOffset;
    VkDeviceSize indexOffset;
    uint32_t vertexSize;
    uint32_t indexSize;
    uint32_t indexCount;
    uint32_t vertexCount;
};
```

## Properties

| Type                        | Description                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bool _indices`             | Indicates whether this buffer contains index data.     |
| `VkBuffer buf`              | The Vulkan buffer handle.                              |
| `VkDeviceMemory mem`        | The Vulkan device memory bound to the buffer.          |
| `VkDeviceSize vertexOffset` | Byte offset to the start of vertex data in the buffer. |
| `VkDeviceSize indexOffset`  | Byte offset to the start of index data in the buffer.  |
| `uint32_t vertexSize`       | Size in bytes of the vertex data region.               |
| `uint32_t indexSize`        | Size in bytes of the index data region.                |
| `uint32_t indexCount`       | Number of indices stored in the buffer.                |
| `uint32_t vertexCount`      | Number of vertices stored in the buffer.               |

## Standard Usage

This struct should be created manually and used as a param for functions that offer a Return Buffer
